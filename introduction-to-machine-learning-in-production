Week1

concept drift / data drift


define project
define data and establish baseline
label and organize data
select and train model 
perform error analysis
deploy in production
monitor & maintain system

Deployment:

Checklist of design choice:

realtime vs Batch
Cloud vs Edge/Browser
Computing Resource (CPU/GPU/Memory)
Latency, Throughput(QPS)
Logging
Security and Privacy

Deployment patterns:

shadow mode
canary deployment
blue green deployment

pick an appropriate degree of automation between human and full automation


Monitoring:

software metrics/input metrics/output metrics
manual/automatic retraining
