high dimension problem: more features, overfit, distance alike and hard to form cluster, concentration in euclidean distance

hughes effect

quantization aware training vs post-training quantization

pruning: connection sparsityï¼Œ sparsity ramp-up

distributed-training: data-parallel, model parallel

data parallel: synchronous vs asynchronous

overcome memory constraints: gradient accumulation, memory swap

pipline parallelism
