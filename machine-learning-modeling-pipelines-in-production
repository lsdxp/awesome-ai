Keras Tuner

AutoML

NAS: Macro/Micro, chain structure/complex multi branch

search strategy: grid search, random search,bayesian optimization,evolutionary methods, reinforcement learning

efficacy: lower fidelity estimates,learning curve extrapolation,weight inheritance/network morphisms

high dimension problem: more features, overfit, distance alike and hard to form cluster, concentration in euclidean distance

hughes effect

quantization aware training vs post-training quantization

pruning: connection sparsityï¼Œ sparsity ramp-up

distributed-training: data-parallel, model parallel

data parallel: synchronous vs asynchronous

overcome memory constraints: gradient accumulation, memory swap

pipline parallelism

knowledge distillation: dark knowledge, KL divergence

model performance analysis: black box evaluation and model introspection

model debugging: brenchmark models,sensitivity analysis,residual analysis

sensitivity-> random attack, partial dependence
informational harm: membership inference,model inversion,model extraction
behavioral harm: poisoning, evasion

residual-> autocorrelation

model remediation: data augmentation, interpretable and explainable ML, model editing,model assertion,discrimination remediation
fairness: TPR,FPR, AUC...
